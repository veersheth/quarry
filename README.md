# quarry

- globalized app/shortcut launcher, written in tauri/svelte
- currently aiming to fix _my_ gripes with already existing app launchers
- lots of inspiration taken from raycast, but i'll be keeping this application open source 
- this is my first big project, so development might be slow. i'd appreciate any feedback :)

```
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run tauri dev
```

FRONTEND
- [x] build out basic list layout
- [x] dumbdown frontend (move ALL functionality to backend)
- [ ] emacs based keybindings? (the ones used in vim insert mode)
- [ ] basic markdown renderer layout
- [ ] grid layout


BACKEND
- [x] basic skeleton 
- [x] module-based structure
- [ ] prefix settings separate from lib.rs 
- [ ] figure out extendability somehow
